## 1. Client Summary
The Gaming Room wanted to exapnd their game Draw it or Lose it to multiple platforms like IOS and Windows. They required a design that would let the game run smoothly across different systems while keeping the same look, feel, and multiplayer features.

## 2. What I Did Well
I think I did a good job at clearly explaining how the application would be built and how each part of it would work together. My design document was organized and well explained. 

## 3. Helpful Parts of the Process
Working through the design document helped me plan ahead before I started working on the code. Looking ahead with the document helped me avoid problems I otherwise would of ran into.

## 4. What I'd Revise
Something that I didnt talk about enough, was how the system would handle crashes or errors. If I could, I would go back and add more of that.

## 5. User's Needs
I focused on what the players would want which was smooth performance and an easy to use UI. Focusing on what the user would want is how you make your application successful. Without users your application failed.

## 6. Design Approach
I started by understanding the requirements, and then I broke them down into parts and found ways to make them work. In the future, I'd do the same thing but I would also make sure that their is earlier testing.
